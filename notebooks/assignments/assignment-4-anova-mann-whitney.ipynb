    "# Overview\n",
    "In this notebook you will be doing a one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) and Mann-Whitney Tests. One-way ANOVA allows you to test the null hypothesis that the means of several groups that represent variations across a single factor are equivelent. The alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the group means is not equal to the rest. One-way ANOVA makes the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data has interval or ratio measurement scales.\n",
    "* The observations in all groups are independent from all other observations.\n",
    "* The data in each group is approximately normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk Test).\n",
    "* There is homogeneity in variance across all groups (Levene's Test).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mann-Whitney Test is a non-parametric test for differences between samples. This means it can be employed like an independent samples T-test but on samples that violate the assumpiton of normality. It is a rank test, which means it can be used on interval or ratio data but also on ordinal data. Mann-Whitney allows you to test the null hypothesis that a randomly selected value from one distribution (modeled with sample 1) is just as likely to be less than as greater than a randomly selected value from a second distrubiton (modeled with sample 2). Another way of stating this null hypothesis is that the there is no difference between the distributions the two samples came from. There is a generalization of Mann-Whitney for testing more than two groups like ANOVA called Kruskalâ€“Wallis One-Way ANOVA. Mann-Whitney makes the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data has ordinal, interval, or ratio measurement scales.\n",
    "* The observations in the groups are independent.\n",
