## About Datasets


Name: cereal.csv
Title: Data for 70+ Cereals
Source: dowloaded 12/18/2017 from the [Kaggle](kaggle.com) public dataset repository. Credited to [Chris Crawford](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford)
Description: Nominal/categorical and ratio/interval data for 70+ different cereals.
Tests: descriptive statistics, t-tests, chi-square test, 

Name: appletrees.csv
Title: Apple Tree Trunk Girth (mm)
Source: S.C. Pearce, University of Kent at Canterbury
Description: The following data represent trunk girth (mm) of a random sample of 60 four-year-old apple trees at East Malling Research Station (England)
Tests: suitable for descriptive statistic calculations 

Name: shoshoni.csv 
Title: Width-to-Length Ratio of Shoshoni Handicraft
Source: Dubois, Cora (ed.) (1960). Lowie's Selected Papers in Anthropology. University of California Press, Berkeley.
Description: The data are width-to-length ratios of beaded rectangles used by the Shoshoni Indians of America to decorate their leather goods. One might ask whether the golden rectangle (for which the width-to-length ratio is 0.618) can be considered an aesthetic standard for the Shoshonis just as it was for the Greeks and the Egyptians.
Tests: One-sample t-test against a true mean of 0.618

Name: beerbottle.csv
Title: Measurement of Beer Head Retention
Source: R.G. Ault, E.J. Hudson, D.J. Linehan, and J.D. Woodward (1967).
"A Practical Approach to the Assessment of Head Retention of Bottled Beers,"
Journal of the Institute of Brewing, Vol. 73, Issue 6, pp. 558-566.
Description: Three aspects of head retention are calculated for 3 bottlings, (n1=n2=20,n3=19):
Head Formation, %Adhesion, and %Collapse Rate of foam.
Readings made:
A = @ 5secons: Top of beer foam
B = @ 30seconds: level of the residual of beer below zero mark
C = @ 240seconds: top of beer foam
D = level of the center of the foam
E = level of the residual beer
%Adhesion = 100((A+B)-(A-C))/(A+B)
%Collapse = 100((A+B)-(D+E))/(A+B)
Tests: One-way ANOVA, independent samples t-test

Name: ozone.csv
Title: Thickness of Ozone Column in Dobson Units, Jan. Feb.
Source: Laboratorium f_r Atmospharensphysic, Switzerland
Description: In the following pairs the data represents the thickness of the ozone column in Dobson units: one milli-centimeter ozone at standard temperature and pressure.
A = monthly mean thickness in January
B = monthly mean thickness in February
The data are paired by year for a random sample of 15 years.
Tests: Paired t-test

Name: reddye40.csv
Title: Red Dye 40 and Cancer in Mice
Source: Journal Natl. Cancer Inst., Vol. 66, p 197-212
Description: S.W. Laagakos and F. Mosteller of Harvard University fed mice different doses of red dye number 40 and recorded the time of death in weeks. Results for female mice, dosage and time of death are shown in the data
X1 = time of death for control group
X2 = time of death for group with low dosage
X3 = time of death for group with medium dosage
X4 = time of death for group with high dosage
Tests: One Way Anova

Source: The Song of Insects by Dr.G.W. Pierce, Harvard College Press
Description: In the following data
X = chirps/sec for the striped ground cricket
Y = temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
Tests: linear regression, rho t-test
